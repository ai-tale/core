### Basic Example

```python
from aitale.core import StoryGenerator, IllustrationIntegrator

# Initialize the story generator with configuration
story_gen = StoryGenerator(config_path="config/config.yaml")

# Generate a story
story = story_gen.generate(
    theme="adventure",
    age_group="6-8",
    protagonist="dragon",
    length="medium"
)

# Generate illustrations for the story
illustrator = IllustrationIntegrator(config_path="config/config.yaml")
illustrated_story = illustrator.illustrate(story)

# Export the illustrated story
illustrated_story.export("my_fairy_tale", format="html")
```

### Using the CLI

```bash
python -m aitale.cli generate --theme "magical forest" --age "4-6" --output "my_story.json"
python -m aitale.cli illustrate --story "my_story.json" --output "my_illustrated_story"
```
